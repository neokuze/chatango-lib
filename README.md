# chatango-lib

A powerful asynchronous Chatango library with aiohttp, written in Python 3.6+

### Library is supposed to be similar in usage for megach.py users, but was based on cherryblossom.

Special thanks to [Sweets](https://github.com/sweets/), [Linkkg](https://github.com/linkkg/megach.py), and [TheClonerx](https://github.com/theclonerx).

Similar usage to "megach.py" by Linkkg & "CherryBlossom" by Sweets. Sweets also motivated me with async, & thanks to [LmaoLover](https://github.com/LmaoLover/) for their help.
